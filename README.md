### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is David Kaspar and I'm a creative data scientist/engineer and design thinker with experience in python, statistical analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing. With a background in math education and entrepreneurship, I build and connect data pipelines, creating robust & performant tools while answering business-centric questions. I transform numbers, data, and abstract ideas into something that makes sense to people and organizations so that they can make informed, data-driven decisions.

## âš¡ Highlighted Projects
#### Data Science Consulting
Due to signing an NDA, I cannot discuss my time as a consultant in detail, but I can confidently say I used the following tools to collaborate with both our internal team and our external clients (technical & non-technical) to solve a wide variety of challenging, data-related problems.
* Source-control: Git, GitHub, Atlassian BitBucket
* Python Machine Learning Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, Tensorflow, SpaCy, NLTK, FB Prophet
* Visualization: Tableau, Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plot.ly
* Cloud Computing: 
    - Amazon Web Services (AWS, S3, EC2, SageMaker)
    - Google Cloud Platform (GCP, App Engine, Compute Engine, Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Cloud AI, Cloud IAM)
    - IBM Watson (Natural Language Understanding, Natural Language Classifier, Speech to Text)

#### [Meander Maker](https://github.com/UpwardTrajectory/meander-maker) (solo developer)

Google Maps is great for finding individual places to go, but if you want to find a cluster of multiple related places, it can take a lot of work. There's a lot of scrolling, saving things for later, interacting with the search bar over and over, and eventually just eyeballing what you think might work, and hoping for the best. This location discovery tool addresses that frustration, and is great for things like:
 * Planning an urban themed walk
 * Efficiently visiting the nearest group of shoe stores
 * Creating an itinerary for winetasting through a cluster of walkable tasting rooms
 * Discovering a neighborhood in a foriegn city with a high density of something you like (museums, gluten-free restaurants, etc)
 * Of course, there's always the good old-fashioned pub crawl
  
Meander Maker leverages user-input to customize the "best" cluster based on how much the end user values:
* High ratings from Google Maps
* Overall quantity of stops within the cluster
* Short initial distance from the user's starting position
* Short transit distance within the stops of the cluster (after initial travel to stop #1 is completed)
